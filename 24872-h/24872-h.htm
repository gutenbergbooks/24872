</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Master Meadow Mouse</span> was pudgy. His
legs were so short and his tail was so short
and his ears were so short that he looked
even fatter than he really was. And
goodness knows he was plump enough&mdash;especially
toward fall when the corn was
ripe.</div>

<p>He lived in Farmer Green's meadow.
And he never harmed anybody. For
Master Meadow Mouse was fat and good-natured.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Friendly folk, such as Paddy Muskrat
and Billy Woodchuck, liked him because
he was good-natured. They always
smiled pleasantly when they spoke of him.
And unfriendly folk, such as Peter Mink
and Tommy Fox, liked him because he
was fat. When they mentioned him they
always grinned horribly and licked their
lips.</p>

<p>Now, it was a pity that in Pleasant Valley,
where Farmer Green's meadow lay,
there were many of the fat-loving kind.
Not only Peter Mink and Tommy Fox,
but Grumpy Weasel, Solomon Owl, Ferdinand
Frog, Henry Hawk and even Miss
Kitty Cat were usually on the watch for
Master Meadow Mouse. Naturally, he
soon learned to be on the lookout for them.
And if he hadn't seen them first he would
never have grown up to be <i>Mister</i> Meadow
Mouse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of all those enemies, Master
Meadow Mouse managed to enjoy life in
Farmer Green's meadow. Usually he
found plenty of seeds to eat. He liked to
swim in Broad Brook. And in winter,
when the snow was deep, he made tunnels
beneath it, and a nest, too, which was snug
and warm under the thick white blanket
that covered it.</p>

<p>The only time Master Meadow Mouse
was ever known to lose his temper was
when Farmer Green mowed the meadow.
Under the high grass Master Meadow
Mouse had been able to run about his well-beaten
paths unseen by hawks. But with
the grass cut and raked, leaving only
naked stubble, he couldn't hide even from
old Mr. Crow. It was no wonder that he
agreed with Bobby Bobolink's wife. The
Bobolink family were so upset by haying
that they moved to Cedar Swamp at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
very first clatter of the mowing machine.
And when Master Meadow Mouse bade
them good-by Mrs. Bobolink said to him,
"What a shame that Farmer Green
should break up a happy home like ours!"
And Master Meadow Mouse remarked
that it was very careless of Farmer Green.
"He might have waited till the snow
comes, at least, before cutting the grass,"
said Master Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>"You'd better move to Cedar Swamp
with us," Mrs. Bobolink suggested. "It's
a fine place. I know, for we lived there
last fall."</p>

<p>But Master Meadow Mouse didn't want
to move.</p>

<p>"The grass will grow again," he explained.
"Farmer Green can't stop the
grass from growing, no matter how often
he cuts it." And of course that was quite
true.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>After haying Master Meadow Mouse
had to be more careful than ever. He
knew that the hawks would scan the
meadow many times a day in hopes of
catching a glimpse of his reddish-brown
back.</p>

<p>Luckily he succeeded in dodging them.
And he dodged a good many other fierce
rascals long after winter with its snow
had descended on Pleasant Valley. Yet
he never complained. He said that danger
kept the days&mdash;and nights too&mdash;from
being dull.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">What</span> is the earliest thing you can remember?
Master Meadow Mouse's earliest
memory was of lying in a soft nest of
dried grasses. Sometimes the nest was in
inky darkness; and then it was night.
Sometimes a shaft of light fell upon the
nest through a round hole just above his
head; and then it was daytime.</div>

<p>That round hole went upwards&mdash;straight
upwards&mdash;for about a foot. And
when Master Meadow Mouse looked
through it he could see, on pleasant days,
a patch of brilliant blue, which was a bit
of sky.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>One day a desire seized him to touch
that round blue spot. So when his
mother was away he crawled up through
the hole. But when he reached the other
end of it he found, to his great surprise,
that the blue disk was ever so much bigger
than he had thought it, and seemed further
away than it had when he gazed at it
through the round tunnel.</p>

<p>All this was very puzzling. And he
stood in the meadow near the mouth of the
tunnel, peering around and wondering
what this, that and the other strange thing
might be. For he saw many wonderful
new sights.</p>

<p>If his mother hadn't come home and
found him out of the nest there's no
telling what would have happened to
him.</p>

<p>"Get back!" she cried, pushing him towards
the mouth of the tunnel&mdash;their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
doorway. "It's a mercy Henry Hawk
hasn't spied you."</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse hung back. He
didn't want to be hurried away from the
new world that he had just discovered.</p>

<p>"I don't see Henry Hawk," he
squeaked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meadow Mouse gave a sort of
grunt.</p>

<p>"Humph! You wouldn't know him if
you saw him," she retorted. "Besides,
he could see you long before you could see
him, for his eyes are wonderfully keen."
Then she gave her son a poke that sent
him into the tunnel and bouncing down
upon the soft nest at the bottom of it.
"You stay there until I come home
again!" she called. "Do you want to go
where your two brothers and your three
sisters went?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Meadow Mouse did not wait for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
her son's answer. She went off again and
left him to ponder over her question.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse decided to mind
his mother. Although he didn't know
what had become of his squirming companions,
who had already begun to crowd
the nest, somehow his mother's query carried
something of a threat. He wondered
if the mysterious Henry Hawk had had
anything to do with the vanishing of the
rest of the children.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse proved to be a
hearty eater. And since he no longer had
to share with others the food that his
mother brought home to him, he grew fast.
It wasn't long before Mrs. Meadow Mouse
took him above ground with her and let
him play near home.</p>

<p>She taught him many things&mdash;how to
find ripe seeds to eat, how to keep still as
a mouse and not squeak when there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
danger of any kind, and how to dodge into
their tunnel when there was need.</p>

<p>Little by little Master Meadow Mouse
wandered further from his own dooryard.
And he began to think that his mother
was too careful. There seemed to be no
need of heeding all her warnings.</p>

<p>Then came the day when he met the kitten
from the farmhouse.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Master Meadow Mouse</span> had rambled
about the meadow without paying much
heed to safety. Although he still seemed
to listen politely whenever his mother
gave him a lecture on dangerous birds or
beasts, half the time he didn't know what
she was saying. He had decided that her
fears were foolish. He was sure that
nothing could harm him.</div>

<p>He was thinking that very thought one
day when he came face to face suddenly
with a huge, furry creature. At least the
stranger seemed terribly big in the eyes of
Master Meadow Mouse, though it was only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a kitten belonging to Miss Kitty Cat, who
lived at Farmer Green's house.</p>

<p>Like Master Meadow Mouse, the kitten
was exploring the meadow. To her, as to
him, it was a new world.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say which of the
two was the more surprised.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Master Meadow Mouse squeaked
right out loud. "I&mdash;I&mdash;I wish I'd stayed
at home."</p>

<p>"Ho!" the kitten mewed. "I'm glad I
came a-hunting."</p>

<p>The kitten sprang at Master Meadow
Mouse. But when he didn't run she
stopped in her tracks and stared at him.
She had expected him to flee, as the mice
at the farmhouse always did whenever a
body met them.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" the kitten
asked him. "Don't you know that
you ought to run when I jump at you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse made no reply.
How could he know that the mice at the
farmhouse were ever so much sprier than
he was and that they always trusted to
their legs to get them out of harm's way?
His family had always done differently.
Unless there was a hole near-by, big
enough for them but too small for a pursuer,
they had ever stood their ground
when attacked and fought while they
could. Master Meadow Mouse knew no
other way. It was something that had
been handed down to him along with his
short tail and his reddish-brown back.</p>

<p>Somehow, as she stood and gazed at
Master Meadow Mouse the kitten thought
he was growing bigger every moment.
She began to feel uneasy about pouncing
on him. It was one thing to clap a paw
down on the back of somebody that was
running away from her. And it was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
entirely different matter to seize a person
that didn't try to escape, but faced her almost
boldly.</p>

<p>"Hunting isn't so much fun as I expected,"
she muttered. For a moment or
two she was tempted to scamper back to
the farmhouse. And then she thought
how pleased her mother would be if she
brought that fat fellow home in her mouth
and laid him at her mother's feet&mdash;how
pleased and how proud!</p>

<p>To help her courage the kitten began
to lash her tail, jerking it from side to
side as she had seen her mother move her
own. And she crouched her chubby body
lower in the grass.</p>

<p>Then the kitten jumped. And the moment
she was within his reach Master
Meadow Mouse gave her a smart nip on
the nose with his sharp little teeth.</p>

<p>The kitten squalled. And she backed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
hastily away. "You'd better run!" she
advised Master Meadow Mouse. "I shall
not give you another chance!"</p>

<p>But he stood fast. And the kitten
didn't give him another chance, either to
run from her, or to bite her nose again.
She fell into a sudden panic and bounded
awkwardly away toward the farmhouse.</p>

<p>And then Master Meadow Mouse ran.
He ran home as fast as he could go.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> whole Meadow Mouse family enjoyed
swimming. They liked to live near water.
That was why they made their home in
the low meadow, where Broad Brook ran
deeper and more quietly than in the hillside
pasture. And Black Creek, too, was
near-by. So the Meadow Mouse family
never had to travel far when they wanted
a cool dip.</div>

<p>Almost as soon as he was able to
wander about the meadow alone Master
Meadow Mouse began to swim. He didn't
have to be taught, any more than he had
to be taught how to walk. Swimming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
came to him as easily as eating. And his
mother never worried about his being
drowned. But when he went for his first
swim in Black Creek Mrs. Meadow Mouse
couldn't help feeling a bit anxious.</p>

<p>"Look out!" she warned her son.
"Look out for the Pickerel tribe!
They're the most dangerous fish in the
creek."</p>

<p>"Yes!" said Master Meadow Mouse.
"I know that. I've been told about them
already."</p>

<p>"You have!" his mother exclaimed.
"Who told you?"</p>

<p>"A greenish gentleman with a very
wide smile and queer, bulging eyes," Master
Meadow Mouse replied.</p>

<p>"That's Ferdinand Frog!" Mrs.
Meadow Mouse cried. "He's as dangerous
as any Pickerel that ever swam.
Where did you meet him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I stood on the bank of the creek one
day and saw him among the lily pads,"
her son explained. "We had quite a long
talk together.... I forgot to mention it
to you," he added.</p>

<p>The news made Mrs. Meadow Mouse
turn slightly pale. She shuddered although
the day was warm; for she feared
and detested Ferdinand Frog.</p>

<p>"Don't ever go near that slippery villain!"
she warned her son. "If you ever
see him when you are swimming in the
creek, make for the shore at once."</p>

<p>Now, Master Meadow Mouse sometimes
thought that he knew more than his
mother, about certain matters. And he
was inclined to take her advice lightly.</p>

<p>"Ferdinand Frog was very pleasant
when I met him," he remarked. "He
cracked jokes. And he laughed at them
himself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he's pleasant enough," Mrs.
Meadow Mouse agreed. "He'd grin and
swallow you at the same time with that
great mouth of his. That's what makes
him so dangerous."</p>

<p>"Well, he's a fine swimmer, anyhow,"
her son declared.</p>

<p>"Another reason why you should avoid
him!" his mother retorted.</p>

<p>"You ought to see him dive," said Master
Meadow Mouse. "He promised to
teach me to dive if I'd join him in the
water."</p>

<p>"It's a mercy you didn't,". Mrs.
Meadow Mouse gasped. "I'm glad you
had sense enough to stay on the bank."</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew better than to take a swim
in the creek that day," Master Meadow
Mouse said. "The Pickerel family were
nosing about among the pickerel weeds
around the bend of the creek. I saw them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
myself. And Mr. Frog told me I ought to
beware of them. He was very anxious&mdash;so
he said&mdash;about me and the Pickerel.
He said he didn't want them to catch me.
He was very kind, I thought."</p>

<p>"Kind!" Mrs. Meadow Mouse spluttered.
"He didn't want them to catch
you because he hopes to catch you himself!"</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Master Meadow Mouse</span> had come to
Black Creek to enjoy his first swim in its
dark, sluggish water. But when he arrived
on the bank he changed his mind
about swimming there that day. For
whom should he see but Ferdinand Frog,
sitting on a rock at the edge of the creek.</div>

<p>For once Master Meadow Mouse was
ready to take his mother's advice. She
had told him to beware of Ferdinand Frog
and never, never, never to enter the water
when that pleasant gentleman was in it.</p>

<p>Ferdinand Frog proved to be as agreeable
as ever. When he caught sight of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Master Meadow Mouse Mr. Frog bade him
a hearty good morning in a deep voice
which was vastly different from the tiny
squeak of the small person on the bank.</p>

<p>"You've come for a swim&mdash;haven't
you?" said Ferdinand Frog.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse admitted that
he <i>had</i> intended to swim. But he explained
that the water looked wetter than
usual and he thought he'd wait till another
day. "Besides," he added, "the sun has
gone under a cloud and my suit wouldn't
dry quickly enough."</p>

<p>"Come right in and have your swim!"
Mr. Frog urged him. "You can change
your clothes as soon as you get home."</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;I can't," said Master Meadow
Mouse.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Mr. Frog asked him.</p>

<p>"Because I haven't any more!"</p>

<p>"Now, that's a pity," Ferdinand Frog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
told him. "A handsome youngster like
you ought to have a best suit to wear on
special occasions."</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse looked interested.</p>

<p>"I'd like a nice new suit," he replied.
"But where am I going to get it?"</p>

<p>"You've come to the right place!" Mr.
Frog cried. "Maybe you didn't know
that I'm a tailor. I'll make you a new
suit myself!"</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you," said Master
Meadow Mouse a bit doubtfully. "But I
don't know how I could pay you."</p>

<p>The tailor laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about that!" he exclaimed.
"I'll get my pay somehow.
And now you must come to my shop at
once. I want to take your measure."</p>

<p>Mr. Meadow Mouse shook his head.</p>

<p>"No!" he told Mr. Frog. "I'm not go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>ing
to your shop. I'm not going a single
step nearer to you than I am now. I've
taken <i>your</i> measure already, Mr. Frog.
I know your game. And you can't catch
me that way."</p>

<p>For once Ferdinand Frog forgot to
laugh. He was so surprised that his
mouth fell wide open as he stared at Master
Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>He had an enormous mouth. Master
Meadow Mouse shivered slightly as he
looked down Mr. Frog's throat.</p>

<p>The tailor closed his mouth almost immediately.
For a huge pickerel came nosing
among the lily pads. And spying Mr.
Frog, he at once darted towards him.</p>

<p>Mr. Frog swam off in great haste.</p>

<p>"That Pickerel person," said Mr.
Meadow Mouse aloud, "means to take Mr.
Frog's measure if he can."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">During</span> his first summer in Pleasant Valley
Master Meadow Mouse had often noticed
old Mr. Crow flying from the woods
to the cornfield. Once in a while Mr.
Crow dropped down into the meadow on
some business or other. But Master
Meadow Mouse did not fear him. The
grass was high in the meadow, screening
the goings and comings of Master Meadow
Mouse from prying eyes.</div>

<p>But after haying time the meadow was
a different place. There was no cover
over Master Meadow Mouse's paths. He
had to be watchful all the time, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Henry Hawk had an unpleasant habit of
sailing high up in the sky and dropping
down like lightning when he saw anybody
like Master Meadow Mouse stirring.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow continued to journey
daily between the cornfield and the woods.
But Master Meadow Mouse paid little
heed to him. He believed Mr. Crow to
be harmless, so long as he didn't catch
small folk in the cornfield. The old gentleman
was very touchy about corn. He
flew into a rage when anybody but himself
ate even one kernel.</p>

<p>Though Master Meadow Mouse would
have liked a taste of corn as much as anybody
else, he was careful to keep away
from the cornfield in the daytime. He
didn't wish to bring down Mr. Crow's
wrath upon his small head.</p>

<p>"Never let Mr. Crow catch you taking
any corn!" Mrs. Meadow Mouse had told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
her son during one of the daily lessons
that she gave him. "If you must have
corn, wait until after sunset. Mr. Crow
goes to bed early."</p>

<span class="caption">Master Meadow Mouse ran plump into old Mr. Crow</span>
</div>
<p>Now, it happened that just before haying
time Mrs. Meadow Mouse had stopped
giving her son lessons. She said that she
had told him everything she knew. She
had told him everything at least a hundred
times. And she declared that if he
hadn't learned what he needed to know,
he never would.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meadow Mouse, however, had forgotten
one thing&mdash;one very important
thing. There was a little trick of old Mr.
Crow's that she had never mentioned to
her son.</p>

<p>So it wasn't his fault that he was caught
unawares one day, soon after Farmer
Green cut the grass in the meadow.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse was tripping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
homewards one day, after a little excursion.
He was traveling fast, for he felt,
amidst the short stubble, as if all the world
were watching him. And he kept a sharp
eye cocked upwards at the sky, lest Henry
Hawk should surprise him. Besides, he
had heard the <i>boom</i> of a bittern that
morning. And the day before he had
seen a butcher-bird skimming low over the
meadow.</p>

<p>Those two, he knew, were every bit as
dangerous as Henry Hawk.</p>

<p>You see, Master Meadow Mouse had
learned to expect birds to descend upon
him from the air. It had never occurred
to him that a bird would lurk on the
ground, in wait for him. So he had a sudden
fright, almost at his doorway, when
he ran plump upon a big black person
standing behind a knoll.</p>


<p>It was old Mr. Crow. And Master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Meadow Mouse thought he had an odd
glitter in his snapping eyes.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I haven't been taking any corn,"
Master Meadow Mouse stammered.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Old</span> Mr. Crow didn't say a single word
when Master Meadow Mouse met him face
to face in the meadow. But a wicked glitter
in Mr. Crow's eyes warned Master
Meadow Mouse that there was trouble
ahead for him.</div>

<p>If the hole leading to his home hadn't
been close at hand there's no telling what
would have happened to him. Anyhow,
just as Mr. Crow lunged at him, with a
wild flapping of his broad wings, Master
Meadow Mouse slipped to one side and
whisked through his doorway.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow coughed hoarsely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your hurry?" he cried.
"I've been waiting around here for you
for a long while. Can't you spend a few
moments of your valuable time with me!"</p>

<p>Now, it was true that the old gentleman
had been lingering in the neighborhood.
The corn wasn't quite ripe enough to suit
him. So he had decided to go a-mousing
that morning.</p>

<p>His way of hunting, however, was not
like that of other birds. Mr. Crow chose
to do his hunting afoot. He was too wise
to waste any effort looking for mice when
the grass was high. But after haying he
had often gone a-mousing in years past.
And he had found the sport to be quite
worth while. Stalking about the close
cropped meadow he had surprised many
distant cousins of Master Meadow Mouse
who never returned home to tell the story
of their meetings with the black scamp.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Maybe Mr. Crow was getting slow in his
old age. He had never come so near to
catching a Meadow Mouse before, only to
be disappointed. It was no wonder that
he felt peevish.</p>

<p>At first Master Meadow Mouse did not
answer Mr. Crow when the old gentleman
called down the tunnel that led to the nest
beneath the sod. But soon Master
Meadow Mouse remembered that Mr.
Crow could get no more than his bill inside
the hole. And then Master Meadow
Mouse found his voice again.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go above ground," he
said. "Can't you talk to me, where I
am?"</p>

<p>"It's not easy to do that," Mr. Crow
grumbled. "I have to speak too loud;
and my voice is hoarse to-day."</p>

<p>"Stick your bill into my tunnel as far
as it will go," Master Meadow Mouse sug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>gested.
"Then you won't have to shout.
I could hear a whisper if you'd do as I
say."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow thrust his bill down the
hole.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," he croaked. "I
can't see you."</p>

<p>"That's because you're shutting out all
the light," Master Meadow Mouse explained.</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Mr. Crow angrily.
"I believe you've drawn a curtain across
the other end of this tunnel. And I can't
talk to anybody through a curtain. I <i>refuse</i>
to injure my voice trying to talk with
anybody that won't give me a more
friendly welcome when I call on him."</p>

<p>"Talk away!" Master Meadow Mouse
urged his caller. "There's nothing between
us to keep me from hearing you.
Nothing but a foot of air!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" Mr. Crow cried. "I <i>knew</i> you
had something in that tunnel. Remove
the air at once, sir, or I'll go away and
leave you."</p>

<p>"If his bill wasn't so hard&mdash;if it was as
soft as the Kitten's nose&mdash;I'd bite it,"
Master Meadow Mouse thought.</p>

<p>And while he was thinking, all at once a
shaft of light trickled inside his house.
Old Mr. Crow had gone grumbling on his
way.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Master Meadow Mouse</span> felt ill at ease.
Now that the grass had been cut from the
meadow he began to think he didn't care
to live there any longer. After his adventure
with old Mr. Crow, Master Meadow
Mouse scarcely dared stray from his dooryard
in the daytime. Anybody, almost,
could see him as he crept through the stubble.</div>

<p>At night he ventured further from
home. And once he went even as far as
the farmyard.</p>

<p>To his surprise he found that the grass
in Farmer Green's yard was longer than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
he had ever seen it. Earlier in the summer,
when Master Meadow Mouse visited
that spot, he had been afraid to cross the
lawn because it was clipped so short. But
now he could creep through the thick
green carpet and nobody could see him,
unless a waving grass blade happened to
catch somebody's eye. Everybody at the
farmhouse had been too busy with haying
to spend any time running a lawn mower.</p>

<p>Why not move to the farmyard? The
thought came into Master Meadow
Mouse's head. It seemed to him that the
farmyard would be a fine place to live.
There was grain scattered here and there,
where somebody had fed the hens. There
was the duck pond near-by, when he
wanted a swim.</p>

<p>"I'll come!" Master Meadow Mouse decided.
"I'll come&mdash;if I can find a good
place for a nest."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon he began to look about for
a site for his new home. And it wasn't
long before he had found one that suited
him. When he saw the woodpile he
squeaked with delight.</p>

<p>"The very place!" he cried. "I'll begin
to built my nest to-night."</p>

<p>So he set to work. He carried dead
leaves and dried grass to the woodpile and
started to make a snug home for himself
in a space between the logs, well inside the
heap of wood. And he had just crept
from a chink and stood under the stars
when a tiny voice greeted him with a cry,
"What ho, stranger!"</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse looked around.
And there on a stick of wood just behind
him was a plump gray person. The newcomer
looked the least bit like Master
Meadow Mouse himself, except that his
tail was ever so much longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm Moses Mouse and I live in
the farmhouse," said the gray gentleman.</p>

<p>"I'm Master Meadow Mouse and I'm
going to live in this woodpile," said the
reddish-brown chap in reply.</p>

<p>"That's good news," Moses Mouse remarked.
"But you must look out for
Miss Snooper," he added.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" Master Meadow Mouse
asked his new friend.</p>

<p>"Miss Snooper&mdash;" Moses Mouse explained&mdash;"Miss
Snooper is our name for
Miss Kitty Cat. She lives in the farmhouse.
And when she isn't indoors she's
usually prowling about the yard."</p>

<p>To the great astonishment of Moses
Mouse, the short-tailed stranger seemed
in no wise startled by his news.</p>

<p>"Huh!" Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed.
"If this Miss Snooper&mdash;as you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
call her&mdash;bothers me, I'll serve her as I
did one of her kittens."</p>

<p>"What did you do to the kitten?"
Moses Mouse inquired with great interest.</p>

<p>"I bit her nose," said Master Meadow
Mouse.</p>

<p>Moses Mouse gazed at him with horror.</p>

<p>"Don't try that on the old lady!" he
cried. "If you do, you'll be sorry."</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Moses Mouse</span>, who lived in the farmhouse,
had warned Master Meadow Mouse. He
had warned him to look out for Miss
Snooper's nose.</div>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse did not pay any
great attention to his new friend's advice.
He was building himself a new home in
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Farmer's'">Farmer</ins> Green's woodpile. And he went
about his work as if there wasn't a cat
within a hundred miles.</p>

<p>Then, one day, he caught a glimpse of
Miss Snooper. He peeped out from a
chink in the woodpile and saw her sitting
on a stick of wood. She was so near him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that Master Meadow Mouse could have
leaped upon her back in one spring.</p>

<p>But he didn't do that. He gazed at her
with round eyes, for Miss Snooper looked
very fierce, especially when she opened her
mouth and showed her sharp teeth as she
yawned. Master Meadow Mouse saw that
she was a quite different creature from
the awkward kitten whom he had bitten
on the nose earlier in the summer.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" thought Master Meadow
Mouse, staring at Miss Snooper with great
awe. "Goodness! Her whiskers are
longer than mine!"</p>

<p>And then he drew back very softly and
crept to his nest in the woodpile.</p>

<p>That night Moses Mouse came to make
another call. And he brought his wife
with him, so that she might see the
stranger with the short tail who was going
to live in Farmer Green's woodpile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw Miss Snooper to-day," Master
Meadow Mouse told them.</p>

<p>"Did you bite her nose?" Mrs. Mouse
asked him eagerly; for her husband had
told her all about the newcomer.</p>

<p>"No!" said Master Meadow Mouse.
"No! I was too busy, building my new
home, to stop and bite her."</p>

<p>"Isn't he brave!" whispered Mrs.
Moses Mouse to her husband.</p>

<p>From where they sat, on the top of the
woodpile, Master Meadow Mouse and his
callers caught sight of a dark shape that
moved stealthily towards them through
the shadows.</p>

<p>"It's Miss Snooper herself!" Mrs.
Mouse cried. And quick as a wink she
dived down among the sticks of wood,
with her husband following close behind
her.</p>

<p>"Probably Master Meadow Mouse will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
bite Miss Snooper's nose this time," she
said to Moses, when she had reached a safe
retreat.</p>

<p>"He isn't biting it now," Moses Mouse
replied, "because he's crowding right behind
me."</p>

<p>"Miss Snooper has come," Mrs. Mouse
said to Master Meadow Mouse. "Maybe
you didn't understand that it was she."</p>

<p>"Let her come!" Master Meadow
Mouse squeaked.</p>

<p>"Isn't he brave!" Mrs. Moses Mouse
murmured.</p>

<p>"I'll bite her nose if she sticks it into
this crevice," Master Mouse declared.</p>

<p>"Isn't he brave!" she breathed into her
husband's ear.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Moses
Mouse in an undertone. "He <i>talks</i> a
good deal about nose-biting. I should
like to see him <i>do</i> it. I knew Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Snooper was skulking around the yard to-night.
That's why I came to call on this
chap. I wanted to see whether he'd fight
or run."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Miss Snooper climbed all
over the woodpile. She could hear faint
squeaks somewhere. And she was almost
frantic because she couldn't squirm under
the wood and find whoever was talking.</p>

<p>It was almost morning before Moses
Mouse and his wife dared to steal back to
the farmhouse. When they left the woodpile
Master Meadow Mouse left it too.
He had decided, during the night, that he
wouldn't live in the farmyard.</p>

<p>"I've become very tired of this old
Cat," he told his companions&mdash;Mr. and
Mrs. Moses Mouse. "I shouldn't care to
stay where I had to see her often."</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Hunting</span> played a great part in the life
of Master Meadow Mouse. Somebody or
other was always hunting him. And he
was always hunting for something to eat.
He spent a good deal of his time away
from home, looking for seeds and grain.
On the other hand, he spent a good deal of
his time in his house; for Master Meadow
Mouse liked to take naps&mdash;especially in
the daytime.</div>

<p>After he started to live in Farmer
Green's woodpile, but moved away from
it before he had finished building his nest
there, Master Meadow Mouse settled near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the fence between the meadow and the
pasture. The mowing machine hadn't
cut the weeds and grass that grew close to
the fence. He found shelter there from
the sharp eyes of birds that would have
caught him had they been able to.</p>

<p>This time Master Meadow Mouse didn't
live underground. He made a sort of little
hut for himself, which kept out the cold
in chilly weather, and shed the rain when
it didn't pour down too hard.</p>

<p>It was a good home. But it had one
drawback. If anybody came along when
its owner was asleep in it&mdash;Well, Master
Meadow Mouse didn't like to think
about that. The little nest at the end of
the tunnel where he had once lived had
been far safer.</p>

<p>"I know what I'll do!" he cried at last,
as a happy thought came to him. "I'll
hang a sign outside my door."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>He set to work. And soon he had
printed a sign. On one side of this was
the notice, "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow."
And on the other side were
the words, "At Home. Don't Knock.
Walk In."</p>

<p>"There!" said Master Meadow Mouse
as he stood off a few paces and looked at
his handiwork. "That ought to do the
trick."</p>

<p>Then he hung the sign outside his door
and went into his house to enjoy a nap.
And the side of the sign that was turned
outward said, "Gone to Lunch. Back To-morrow."</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse slept late into
the afternoon. And towards sunset,
while he was still asleep, Tommy Fox
slipped through the pasture fence.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he murmured softly as his
eyes fell on Master Meadow Mouse's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
dwelling. "Here's a bit of luck. I smell
a Mouse. And he must be taking a nap
inside his house."</p>

<p>Tommy Fox crept closer to the little
hut. Then all at once he straightened up
with a look of displeasure on his sharp
face. He had just noticed the sign.</p>

<p>"He's away from home!" Tommy exclaimed.
"That's a pity. He can't have
been gone long. Maybe I can catch him
near-by."</p>

<p>But he couldn't find Master Meadow
Mouse anywhere. He looked all around&mdash;except
inside the shelter where Master
Meadow Mouse was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Tommy Fox came back and read the
sign once more.</p>

<p>"Back To-morrow," he muttered.
"Very well! I'll come back here to-morrow.
For that's what the sign tells me to
do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>And the next day he returned. He
grinned from ear to ear as he read what
the sign said: "At Home. Don't Knock.
Walk In." Then he thrust his long,
sharp nose right through Master Meadow
Mouse's doorway.</p>

<p>There was nobody there. And Tommy
Fox looked silly as anything.</p>

<p>"Fooled!" he growled. "Fooled by a
Meadow Mouse! I hope nobody ever
finds it out."</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> seemed as if Master Meadow Mouse
was always moving. Perhaps the pleasantest
move he ever made was when he
went to the cornfield to live. When autumn
came Farmer Green shocked the
corn. All over the field bundles of cornstalks
stood in rows, like soldiers. And
what suited Master Meadow Mouse especially
was the ripe ears in the shocks, which
Farmer Green had not yet gathered.</div>

<p>For some weeks past Master Meadow
Mouse had been living in a rude shelter,
which he had built for himself near the
fence between the pasture and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
meadow. Though he had been quite comfortable
there during the hot weather,
there were days, now, when a chilly wind
swept through Pleasant Valley and made
him shiver slightly as he thought of the
frosts which his neighbors told him were
on the way.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to seek some
snugger home. But not until he saw what
Farmer Green was doing with the cornstalks
did Master Meadow Mouse decide
on his new dwelling.</p>

<p>"What a fine idea of Farmer Green's!"
he cried, when he first looked upon the
shocked corn. "I never dreamed that he
had been raising corn to make homes for
our family." He changed his opinion of
Farmer Green. Master Meadow Mouse
had been much upset when Farmer Green
cut the grass in the meadow at haying
time. All the birds in the air could see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
him whenever he crossed the bare field.
Now, however, he forgot his displeasure
in the joy that Farmer Green's latest
move gave him.</p>

<p>That night Master Meadow Mouse
crept into the cornfield. The round, yellow
harvest moon shone down on the field,
bathing the shocks of corn in a flood of
light and making the pumpkins that lay
on every side look almost as golden as they
appeared under the midday sun.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse was surprised to
find that many of his cousins had had the
same happy thought about moving that
had come to him. He met dozens of the
big Meadow Mouse family that night.
And every one of them was intent on picking
out a shock of corn to live in.</p>

<p>Luckily there were shocks enough for
all&mdash;and more. And no disputes arose.
Some wanted to settle near the fence.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Some preferred to live in the middle of
the field. Many decided to make their
new homes near Broad Brook, so they
could enjoy a swim now and then without
having to travel far to get to the water.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse was one of the
best swimmers. He found a huge shock
that stood near the bank of the brook.
Crawling through it, he discovered at least
two dozen ears of ripe corn there.</p>

<p>"I won't look any further," he exclaimed.
"Here's food enough to last for
months, all stored for me and ready to be
eaten whenever I'm hungry."</p>

<p>Then he set to work. And high in the
top of the shock he made himself a nest of
dry husks, which he stripped off some of
the ears.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to build that
home. Everything that he needed was
right at hand. And it was no time at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
before Master Meadow Mouse had his
house in order. Then he was ready for a
nap. But first he made a hearty meal of
corn because&mdash;as he said&mdash;he always slept
better on a full stomach.</p>

<p>As he settled himself at last in his new
quarters, just before he dozed off Master
Meadow Mouse murmured happily to
himself.</p>

<p>"I never thought," he said, "that I'd
sleep in a castle in the air."</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Master Meadow Mouse</span> had always been
pudgy. Before he went to the cornfield
to live he had been fat enough. And after
he had spent two weeks in and out of his
new nest in the cornshock he was a sight
to see. His sides bulged. And he had a
look as if his skin weren't big enough for
him.</div>

<p>Life had become very easy for Master
Meadow Mouse. He didn't even have to
leave home to get all the corn he could eat.
He simply crept out of his nest, and right
there in his cornshock he had two dozen
ears of ripe corn. He didn't need to set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
foot to the ground, unless he wanted a
drink.</p>

<p>Of course Master Meadow Mouse
wasn't content to stay at home morning,
noon and night. He scampered away
whenever he pleased. Sometimes he went
for a swim in Broad Brook. Sometimes
he visited his cousins, who dwelt in other
shocks in the cornfield. And every night
he joined the big Meadow Mouse family in
a frolic. They chased one another around
the pumpkins that strewed the ground,
dodged behind the shocked corn, or ran
along the rail fence.</p>

<p>During the daytime Master Meadow
Mouse and his companions lay low.
When they went abroad they kept a close
watch for Mr. Crow. Late as it was, the
old gentleman still lingered in Pleasant
Valley. Although his cronies had started
on their yearly journey to the South, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
let it be known that he was expecting to
spend the winter in the North.</p>

<p>"I've noticed signs," he had said, "that
tell me we're going to have a mild winter."</p>

<p>Whenever Mr. Crow visited the cornfield,
the Meadow Mouse family hastened
to hide. They didn't try to go to their
own homes, but plunged inside the nearest
shocks of corn.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow was far from stupid. He
knew what was going on right under his
nose&mdash;or his bill. Flapping towards the
cornfield from the woods he could see a
great scurrying of small, reddish-brown
persons. But when he settled down in the
field there was never a Meadow Mouse
anywhere in sight.</p>

<p>"They're stealing corn!" the old gentleman
spluttered. "I'd stop them if I
could. But what can I do when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
hide the moment they see me coming?"</p>

<p>The old fellow pondered over the question.</p>

<p>"Somebody," he said, "will have to tear
these shocks apart in order to catch the
Meadow Mouse people. And I don't
know anyone that could do it better than
Fatty Coon."</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Crow knew where Fatty Coon
lived, in a hollow tree in Cedar Swamp.
And he actually started to fly over to the
Swamp and ask Fatty Coon to rid the
cornfield of the Meadow Mouse family.</p>

<p>But on the way to Cedar Swamp Mr.
Crow happened to think of something.
He happened to think that Fatty Coon
had an enormous appetite and was very
fond of corn.</p>

<p>Mr. Crow suddenly veered off his
straight course and alighted in a tree.</p>

<p>"That will never do," he croaked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
"Fatty would eat more than all the
Meadow Mice in Pleasant Valley."</p>

<p>Little did Mr. Crow know that Fatty
Coon was already planning to visit the
cornfield as soon as it grew dark.</p>

<p>Nor did Master Meadow Mouse and his
cousins guess that they were to have an
unwelcome guest that night.</p>

<p>As usual, after dark they poured out of
their castles in the air to enjoy their
nightly frolic. And they were having
what they called "high jinks" when the
word went around to hide.</p>

<p>For somebody squeaked in a frightened
voice: "Fatty Coon is crawling through
the pasture fence!"</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">The</span> Meadow Mouse party, in the cornfield,
vanished as if by magic. Not one of
the merrymakers lingered an instant after
hearing that Fatty Coon was entering the
field. And since Master Meadow Mouse
happened to be near the shock where he
lived, he ran up it in a twinkling and crept
inside it, to curl up in his nest and try to
catch forty winks.</div>

<p>He felt safe enough. Hadn't old Mr.
Crow come to the cornfield every day?
<i>He</i> had never even poked into a shock to
disturb Master Meadow Mouse or one of
his cousins. Mr. Crow had eaten corn, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
be sure. But he hadn't bothered anybody.
And now Master Meadow Mouse
thought that as soon as Fatty Coon had
stuffed himself with corn he would stroll
back to Cedar Swamp.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse had fallen into
a doze when a sharp rustle waked him.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" he chuckled. "There's
Fatty Coon now! He's pulling an ear of
corn off my shock. Well, I don't believe
I'll miss it. There's corn enough in this
field for everybody."</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse tried to go to
sleep again.</p>

<p>"I wish Fatty Coon wouldn't make so
much noise," said Master Meadow Mouse,
grumbling a little because he was very
drowsy and didn't like to be disturbed.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed after a few moments.
"He's gone, thank goodness!"</p>

<p>But Fatty Coon had only carried his ear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of corn to Broad Brook, to wash it before
he gobbled the kernels. He was very particular
to wash almost everything he ate.
But that was about the only way in which
he was fussy. There was nothing, almost,
that he wouldn't bolt greedily.</p>

<p>After he had devoured the first ear of
corn, Fatty Coon went back and pulled
another off the same shock.</p>

<p>Again he roused Master Meadow Mouse
from his slumbers.</p>

<p>"He's at it again!" Master Meadow
Mouse complained. "I wish he'd go to
some other shock."</p>

<p>The third time that Fatty Coon
wrenched an ear of corn from the shock
where Master Meadow Mouse lived he
paused and cocked an ear towards the top
of the shock.</p>

<p>"Was that a squeak?" he asked himself.
And then he sniffed. "Ha!" he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cried. "Do I smell a Meadow Mouse?"</p>

<p>Fatty Coon was not mistaken. When
he rustled the dried cornstalks the third
time, Master Meadow Mouse had cried
right out in his sleep. And he waked up
just soon enough to hear Fatty Coon's
remarks.</p>

<p>"Maybe you do smell a Meadow
Mouse," he replied under his breath, so
Fatty Coon couldn't hear him. "But it
won't do you any good; for I'm not coming
out of my castle until you go away."</p>

<p>It soon appeared that Fatty Coon did
not intend to leave. For Fatty began to
pull at the cornstalks with his claws. Although
Farmer Green had bound the
stalks together tightly, one by one Fatty
tore them loose and let them fall upon the
ground.</p>

<p>And inside the shock Master Meadow
Mouse suddenly started up in alarm.</p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-14head.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt="14: The Masked Bandit" title="14: The Masked Bandit" />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> was no wonder that Master Meadow
Mouse was startled. He cowered inside
his nest in the top of the shock of corn.
The whole shock shook. There was a terrible
rustle of dry leaves as Fatty Coon
tore away stalk after stalk.</div>

<p>"Old Mr. Crow never did this!" Master
Meadow Mouse stammered. "He never
disturbed my rest. But this awful Fatty
Coon means to catch me. And I don't
know what to do."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Fatty Coon was muttering
horribly to himself as he worked.</p>

<p>"This fellow must be fat," he grunted,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as he wrenched at a stubborn stalk with
claws and teeth. "With all this corn to
feast on he must be in fine trim. Mm!
He ought to be just right to top off a good
meal of corn."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Master Meadow Mouse
gasped. "How annoying! He intends
to eat me!"</p>

<p>For a few moments Master Meadow
Mouse wondered whether he ought to fight
or run. "I wish," he thought, "that I'd
brought my old sign with me when I
moved to this new home. If I had hung
it outside my door Fatty Coon wouldn't
have bothered me. When he read that
notice, 'Gone to lunch. Back To-morrow,'
he would have shuffled off about his
business." But idle thoughts and wishes
were of no use at a time like that. Master
Meadow Mouse soon realized that he must
act&mdash;and act quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe I'll bite his nose," he said to
himself. "But I want to peep at him
first."</p>

<p>So Master Meadow Mouse left his nest
and crept a short distance until he could
peer out from a chink between two cornstalks.
In the moonlight he had a fine
view of Fatty Coon. And as he stared at
the intruder Meadow Mouse shuddered.</p>

<p>"No!" he exclaimed. "No! I never
could fight him. I wouldn't dare bite his
nose. He's far, far too big for me to
tackle."</p>

<p>There was no denying that Fatty Coon
looked both huge and dangerous. Across
his face was a black mask which only
added to his horrid appearance. And
through the mask his eyes shone green and
greedy right into the frightened ones of
Master Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>One good look was enough for Master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Meadow Mouse. He drew back hurriedly.
Through his mind there flashed a saying
of his mother's that he had not thought
of for a long time: "He that fights and
runs away will live to fight another day."</p>

<p>"I'll run first," Master Meadow Mouse
decided. "Then perhaps I shan't have to
fight at all."</p>

<p>Then he stole out of the shock of corn,
on the opposite side. And when Fatty
Coon pawed his way through to the nest
he found it empty.</p>

<p>He gave a wail of anger and dismay.</p>

<p>"He's gone! The Meadow Mouse has
gone!" Fatty bawled. "And I'll warrant
he was a fat one, too. It's always the fattest
ones that get away. And nobody can
deny that this one was living high."</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">This</span> means another move for me," said
Master Meadow Mouse. Fatty Coon had
broken into the house in the shock of corn
where Master Meadow Mouse had been
living. And Master Meadow Mouse had
fled.</div>

<p>Somehow he felt that a change of scene
would be good for him. Although he had
dwelt but a short time in the cornfield, he
had no longer any desire to stay there.
For Fatty Coon had given him a great
fright. There was no denying that.</p>

<p>"It seems as if I were always moving,"
Master Meadow Mouse mused. "It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
lucky for me the world is wide. Thank
goodness there's plenty of places left
where I can go. I've tried the meadow,
Farmer Green's woodpile, the tangle beside
the pasture fence and the cornfield.
And now&mdash;now let me see! I believe I'll
settle along Black Creek, under the
bank."</p>

<p>He was talking with Long Bill Wren,
who had a nest in a marshy spot near the
creek.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't make yourself a home under
the bank!" Long Bill cried. "The fall
rains will come soon. The creek is sure to
rise. And then where will you be?"</p>

<p>"I'll be in the water, I suppose," Master
Meadow Mouse answered.</p>

<p>"Correct!" said Long Bill Wren.
"And you want to avoid that. Maybe
you've noticed that my wife and I built
our nest off the ground. We fasten it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the reeds so we'll be dry, no matter if
there's a freshet in midsummer."</p>

<p>"Ah!" Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed
with a smile. "I see you don't
like water as much as I do. The fall rains
won't trouble me. If the creek rises as
high as my house it will be all the more
fun."</p>

<p>Long Bill Wren gave him an odd look.</p>

<p>"You're a queer one," he remarked.
"Anyhow, you can't say I didn't warn
you. If there's a flood when the fall rains
come, and you get drowned out, you can't
say it's my fault."</p>

<p>"Certainly not!" cried Master Meadow
Mouse. "And I thank you for your kind
advice. But I'm not going to be drowned
out. I can swim."</p>

<p>Long Bill Wren shook his head.</p>

<p>"I hope you'll escape," he said. "I
shall not be here to know whether you do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
or not. For we're starting for the South
to-morrow. But I hope to find you safe
and sound next May, when I return."
And then he went home, to tell his wife
that Master Meadow Mouse was a very
daring young fellow.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse built himself a
house under the bank of Black Creek.
And later the rain fell heavily for several
days and nights, just as Long Bill Wren
had expected. The creek rose fast. Yet
Master Meadow Mouse didn't worry.
When the water lapped at his doorway he
only laughed. And when it caught at his
house and bore it downstream Master
Meadow Mouse held his fat sides and
roared.</p>

<p>The flood brought much rubbish with it.
But Master Meadow Mouse saw nothing
that took his fancy until at last a floating
board caught his eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse swam out to it
and scrambled upon it.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" he squeaked as the board
carried him along with the current.
"This is fine! I've got a raft. And I'll
go a-traveling."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">A board</span> was floating along on the swollen
waters of Black Creek. On it sat Master
Meadow Mouse. He was very happy.
He was having his first ride, of any sort.</div>

<p>"This raft&mdash;" he said to himself
proudly&mdash;"this raft belongs to me. I'll
be a traveler. I'll see the world&mdash;at least
as far as the big willow at the lower end
of the meadow!"</p>

<p>He scarcely cared to go beyond the big
willow. Beyond it lay another farm.
And Master Meadow Mouse had never
been off Farmer Green's place in his
whole life. He feared that he might not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
be able to find his way back, if he ventured
too far from home.</p>

<p>Soon he spied a friend on the bank of
the creek. Master Meadow Mouse cried,
"Good-by!" and waved a paw at him.</p>

<p>The person on the bank was one of his
many cousins. And when he caught sight
of Master Meadow Mouse he stared hard
for a few moments. Then he shouted,
"Don't jump! I'll rescue you." He
was already running to the water's edge
when Master Meadow Mouse stopped
him.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be rescued," he called.
"I'm seeing the world."</p>

<p>His cousin hurried along the bank, still
watching the strange sight.</p>

<p>"It seems to me&mdash;" he told Master
Meadow Mouse&mdash;"it seems to me that the
world is seeing you. Where would you
hide if Henry Hawk discovered you?"</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse did not answer.
To tell the truth, the question set him to
thinking. He had to admit that it might
be a bit awkward to find any cover in case
somebody or other made a sudden swoop
at him.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!" he said at last. "It can't
be helped. There's always <i>some</i> danger
in traveling&mdash;so I've heard."</p>

<p>His cousin on the bank had stopped
running and now stood still and watched
him anxiously until the raft had borne
Master Meadow Mouse out of sight around
a bend.</p>

<p>As the flood swung the craft toward the
further side of the creek Master Meadow
Mouse beheld a long-legged fisherman
standing in the water. Not only did the
fisherman have long legs. He had a long
bill as well. And he was standing like a
statue, waiting for a fish to swim past him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
A fish, or a frog, or a mouse! He didn't
care which.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse knew him at
once. He was Mr. Great Blue Heron&mdash;or
plain "G. B." as he preferred to be
called. While Master Meadow Mouse
gazed at him in horror Mr. Heron swiftly
thrust his spearlike bill into the water.
Even his head went out of sight for a
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. Heron did not do that in order to
cool his head. Ah, no! When he pulled
his bill out of the creek a pickerel came
with it. And the pickerel vanished very
quickly down Mr. Heron's long neck.</p>

<p>It was not a nice sight for Master
Meadow Mouse to see, especially when he
was on a pleasure trip. Besides, he noticed
with dismay that his raft was bearing
him straight towards the fisherman.</p>

<p>"If I only had some oars, or a rudder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
I could steer this old raft away from him,"
Master Meadow Mouse thought. But he
had nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse groaned.</p>

<p>"I wish I'd never gone a-traveling!"</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Nearer</span> and nearer the board, with Master
Meadow Mouse upon it, drifted around
the bend of the creek toward Mr. Great
Blue Heron. And at last Mr. Heron noticed
it. And he noticed its passenger,
too.</div>

<p>"Ahem!" he said softly to himself.
Except for swallowing once or twice, he
never made a move, but stood there in the
water and waited. He waited for Master
Meadow Mouse's raft to drift closer; for
it was plain to him&mdash;as to Master Meadow
Mouse&mdash;that the current of Black Creek
was slowly bearing the board straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
down upon him. "When it gets near
enough I'll just reach out and pluck that
fellow off," Mr. Heron promised himself
with a sort of silent chuckle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Master Meadow Mouse was
having a very bad quarter of an hour.
Slowly though his craft moved, to him it
seemed to travel with lightning speed.</p>

<p>"I'll pass him soon," Master Meadow
Mouse thought. "If I crouch down and
make myself as small as possible perhaps
he won't see me."</p>

<p>So he hugged the board tight. But the
closer he came to Mr. Heron the bigger
and fiercer that gentleman looked.</p>

<p>Suddenly Master Meadow Mouse's
courage oozed out through his toes. He
couldn't stay on his raft another second.
Springing to his feet, he scurried to the
edge of the board and slipped off it into
the water.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>At his first move Mr. Heron moved too.
He lifted his great wings and flapped
them, tucking his legs under his body at
the same time. A half dozen flaps carried
him abreast of the floating board.
And there Mr. Heron let his long legs
down into the water until he stood again
upon the bottom of the creek. He
scanned the water eagerly, even plunging
his head into it and looking all around.
But he couldn't see Master Meadow
Mouse anywhere.</p>

<p>"This is queer," he mumbled. "I
knew those fellows were good swimmers.
But I didn't think this one could get away
from me so quickly."</p>

<p>Mr. Great Blue Heron waded about the
creek for some time, searching everywhere&mdash;or
almost everywhere. And
while he was searching, the deserted raft
swung off down the creek, hung for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
moments at the edge of the channel, and
then drifted lazily toward shore, where it
lodged at last among the reeds.</p>

<p>The disappointed fisherman returned
to his fishing. But it seemed as if his luck
had turned. Not another fish came his
way. And being too wise to expect that
another Meadow Mouse would come traveling
down the creek on a raft, Mr. Great
Blue Heron at last forsook his sport and
sailed away through the air towards the
lake on the other side of Blue Mountain.</p>

<p>He hadn't been gone a great while when
Master Meadow Mouse might have been
seen picking his way along the bank. He
was journeying upstream, on his way
home.</p>

<p>"It was lucky for me&mdash;" he explained
to his cousin, whom he met later&mdash;"it was
lucky for me that I could swim under
water. Otherwise I shouldn't have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
able to hide beneath the board and stay
there until it swung into the rushes."</p>

<p>"You had a narrow escape," his cousin
told him. "Don't say that I didn't warn
you!"</p>

<p>That cousin was one of those persons
that always exclaim, "I told you so!"</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Winter</span> had come. The snow lay deep
over Pleasant Valley. But Master
Meadow Mouse didn't object to that. On
the contrary, he had welcomed the snow.
Even Johnnie Green, peeping out of his
chamber window at the first snowfall of
the season, hadn't been any happier over
it than Master Meadow Mouse was. To
Johnnie Green the snow meant fun. To
Master Meadow Mouse it meant fun and
something more.</div>

<p>At last he could scamper about the
meadow without being seen by everybody.
For he set to work at once to make tunnels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
beneath the snow. They ran in every
direction from his house. And he was
forever pushing them further and further.</p>

<p>Through those tunnels Master Meadow
Mouse could look for seeds and grain in
the stubble. And while he was rambling
along his network of halls he didn't have
to worry about anybody's making trouble
for him, unless it was Peter Mink, perhaps,
or Grumpy Weasel.</p>

<p>Of course Master Meadow Mouse didn't
stay under the snow all the time. Now
and then he liked to climb up into the
open air. And he made many shafts that
led to the world above.</p>

<p>Although most of the birds had gone
South to spend the winter, there were still
some that Master Meadow Mouse had to
shun. Old Mr. Crow was spending the
winter on the farm. And there were
Solomon Owl and his cousin Simon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Screecher, who hunted over the meadow
nightly. And at dusk sometimes a fierce
hawk known as "Rough-leg" would beat
his way back and forth across the snow
covered stretches in the hope of catching
one of the Meadow Mouse family unawares.</p>

<p>In spite of such unpleasant neighbors,
the big Meadow Mouse family managed to
have many a gay frolic under the stars on
crisp winter nights. Sometimes Johnnie
Green, wandering over the fields on snow-shoes
by day, noticed a lacy tracery on
the snow. It was the tracks of the tiny
toes of Master Meadow Mouse and his
dozens of cousins. At first Johnnie almost
thought that he had stumbled upon
the scene of a revel of fairy mice. He did
not know then that the Meadow Mouse
family had a village of their own right
under his feet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>But Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher
and old Rough-leg, the hawk, knew all
about the habits of the villagers. In fact
they sometimes complained about the way
the Meadow Mouse family had built their
tunnels. They agreed that there were too
many holes leading down to the village
streets. It gave the Meadow Mouse people
too many openings into which to dive
in case of a sudden surprise when they
were having a moonlight party.</p>

<p>"If they ever invited me to one of their
affairs I wouldn't care what they did,"
Solomon Owl remarked one evening to his
whistling cousin, Simon Screecher. "If
they'd welcome me just once to one of
their dances I'd be satisfied."</p>

<p>"It's plain that they don't like you,"
his cousin remarked.</p>

<p>"Nor you, either!" Solomon Owl
boomed. And then all at once he burst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
forth with a peal of ghostly laughter.
<i>"Wha, wha, whoo-ah!</i>"</p>

<p>Now, Master Meadow Mouse had just
crept out of one of his doorways and was
looking up at the stars when that shivery
sound came rolling out of the woods.
When he heard it he turned quickly and
hurried back where he came from.</p>

<p>"There won't be any fun to-night," he
grumbled.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">There's</span> no sense in wasting our time
here," said Solomon Owl to his small
cousin, Simon Screecher. "It's a fine
night. The Mice will all be out sooner
or later. Let's go over and sit in that old
oak on the edge of the meadow!"</div>

<p>Simon Screecher was more than willing.
And they had no sooner settled
themselves among the bare branches of the
oak when Simon started to amuse himself
by giving his well-known quavering
whistle.</p>

<p>Solomon Owl stopped him quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" he said sharply. "Do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
you want to scare the Mice?" Simon
Screecher cut his whistle off right in the
middle of it.</p>

<p>"I forgot," he murmured. "But I
don't believe my whistling would do any
harm. I don't think there are many Mice
left on Farmer Green's place. It's my
opinion that they've moved away&mdash;most
of them. Or maybe old Rough-leg, the
Hawk, has caught more than his share.
Anyhow, it's so long since I ate a Meadow
Mouse that I've almost forgotten what
they're like."</p>

<p>Solomon Owl made no reply. He was
a person of few words. If anybody
asked his opinion he was ready to give
it. But he seldom gave any unsought
advice.</p>

<p>"I've about made up my mind," said
Simon Screecher, "that I'd move to some
other neighborhood. If I knew where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there was good mousing I'd move to-morrow."</p>

<p>While he was speaking, Solomon Owl
started ever so slightly. And he cocked
his head on one side, as if he were listening
for something.</p>

<p>At that moment his cousin began to
whistle again.</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" Solomon Owl thundered.
"If I'm not mistaken I heard a squeak.
But no Meadow Mouse will ever venture
out of doors if you're going to whistle."</p>

<p>"I forgot," said Simon Screecher once
more. "I'm so used to whistling that I
don't know when I'm doing it."</p>

<span class="caption">Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher wait for Master Meadow Mouse</span>
</div>

<p>"That's the reason why you can't catch
more Mice," Solomon Owl snapped; for
he was angry. "There are dozens of
Meadow Mice under the snow. But of
course you can't surprise them if you tell
them you're coming. You might as well<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
send them a telegram, saying that you'll
be on hand to meet them at eight <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>"</p>

<p>Simon Screecher was silenced for the
time being.</p>

<p>And it wasn't long before Solomon Owl
gave another start.</p>

<p>"There's that squeak again!" he whispered.
"I believe it is getting nearer,
too."</p>

<p>Now, Master Meadow Mouse had a tunnel
that led right beneath the tree where
the two cousins were sitting. And he
had strolled that way after scurrying
under the snow when he heard Solomon
Owl laughing in the woods earlier in the
evening.</p>

<p>It was he that Solomon heard. It was
he that stuck his head out of a hole in the
snow and peeped up at the star-sprinkled
sky.</p>

<p>Solomon Owl saw him. And he dived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
out of the old oak straight at Master
Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse pulled his head
in just in time.</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose that chap would be
here as soon as this," he gasped. "He
must have hurried over here from the
woods. He must be very hungry."</p>

<p>As Solomon Owl returned to the old
oak his cousin Simon Screecher laughed
somewhat unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Missed him&mdash;didn't you?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you grab him out of the
snow?" Simon asked. "What are your
claws for? What's your beak for?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't dig him out," Solomon Owl
replied. "The snow is three feet deep.
And it has seven different crusts, one
under another."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is a hard winter," said Simon
Screecher. "I wish I'd gone South last
fall. I wonder how the mousing is down
there."</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">As Simon Screecher</span> remarked to his
cousin, Solomon Owl, it was a hard winter.
The snow was deep. The days were cold.
And the nights were colder. And, worst
of all, food became scarce. It seemed as
if there wasn't anything to eat anywhere
except at the farm buildings, which
Farmer Green had stuffed full of hay and
grain during the summer and autumn.
Many of the forest folk stole down from
Blue Mountain after nightfall and visited
the farmyard in the hope of getting a bite
of something or other.</div>

<p>Even Master Meadow Mouse began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
find it harder and harder to get enough
seeds under the snow to satisfy his hunger.
He had stored away a stock of food.
But it hadn't been big enough. And that
was a great mistake. Master Meadow
Mouse promised himself that he would
not repeat it another time. Unfortunately,
all the promises in the world
wouldn't give him a square meal when he
needed one.</p>

<p>At last he went to one of his cousins
who had already spent one winter in the
meadow.</p>

<p>"This is my first winter," Master
Meadow Mouse explained. "I'm running
short of food. And I wish you'd
tell me what to do in such a case."</p>

<p>"That's easy," his cousin answered.
"Get more!" And then he hurried away,
for he had important business to attend to.</p>

<p>Poor Master Meadow Mouse ran after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
him. It was hard to follow his cousin
through the winding galleries beneath the
snow. Several times Master Meadow
Mouse took the wrong turn and had to
retrace his steps. But at last he found
his busy cousin again.</p>

<p>"You advised me to get more food,"
said Master Meadow Mouse. "But you
didn't tell me where to get it."</p>

<p>"In the orchard!" his cousin cried.
And then he hurried away again.</p>

<p>"I wish he'd wait a minute," Master
Meadow Mouse grumbled as he tore after
his cousin once more. "I don't feel like
running. I haven't had a hearty meal for
days."</p>

<p>The cousin seemed surprised when
Master Meadow Mouse overtook him.</p>

<p>"What!" that busy gentleman exclaimed.
"Have you been to the orchard
and back so soon?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" said Master Meadow Mouse.
"I've been chasing you. I want you to
tell me what I'll find to eat when I go to
the orchard."</p>

<p>"That's easy," his cousin replied.
"Trees!" Having said those three words
he dashed off again even faster than before.</p>

<p>"Trees!" Master Meadow Mouse
echoed. "I can't eat trees. I've never
eaten a tree in all my life. There must
be something that my cousin forgot to
explain. So I suppose I'll have to run
after him again and ask him what he
meant."</p>

<p>The fourth time that Master Meadow
Mouse found his cousin he took no
chances. He caught his cousin by his tail
and held on firmly.</p>

<p>"You're not going to get away from
me till I've found out what I want to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
know," he declared. "How can I eat a
tree?" Master Meadow Mouse demanded.</p>

<p>"You can't!" his cousin replied, struggling
desperately to free himself, for he
was too busy to stop long.</p>

<p>"Then explain what you mean!" Master
Meadow Mouse cried.</p>

<p>"Eat the bark!" his cousin answered.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;and not till then&mdash;did Master
Meadow Mouse let him go.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse chased his
cousin no more, but hurried away to
Farmer Green's orchard, where he gnawed
a ring all the way around one of the young
fruit trees, at the top of the snow. It was
the first big meal he had enjoyed for
weeks. And he went home feeling that
the winter was not so hard as he had
thought, after all.</p>

<p>But Farmer Green didn't agree with
him. When he happened to go into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
orchard one day, later, and saw tree after
tree ruined, he was very, very much displeased.</p>

<p>"I ought to have put wire netting
around those young trees," he told the
hired man. "This is what comes of a
hard winter."</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> one way Peter Mink was like Master
Meadow Mouse. He enjoyed swimming.
And he spent a great deal of his time along
the streams that threaded their way
through Pleasant Valley. Sometimes
Peter dawdled on the banks of Swift
River. Sometimes he lingered for days
in the neighborhood of Black Creek.
Nor did he disdain so small a stream as
the brook that crossed the meadow. It
was deep enough for a swim. And he
knew that muskrats lived under its banks.
While as for meadow mice&mdash;well, Peter
Mink had surprised many a one swim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ming
in the brook. If it hadn't been for
the meadow mice perhaps he wouldn't
have visited the brook so often.</div>

<p>Even in winter Master Meadow Mouse
just <i>had</i> to have his cold dip now and
then. So he ran one of his many snow
tunnels to the brook, making a little opening
that led under the ice, where the water
had fallen away and left a cavern. Just
because there was skating for Johnnie
Green on top of the brook it mustn't be
supposed that Master Meadow Mouse
wasn't going to have a swim when he
wanted one.</p>

<p>When Peter Mink wandered along a
stream in winter he preferred to travel
under the ice, rather than walk upon the
upper side of it. It made little difference
to him whether there was a dry strip along
the edge of the stream, where he could
steal silently along without wetting his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
feet. When he found no place to walk,
he swam.</p>

<p>Now, Master Meadow Mouse was well
aware of this trick of Peter Mink's&mdash;this
trick of lurking beneath the ice of river,
creek and brook. But Master Meadow
Mouse <i>would</i> have his cold dip now and
then despite Peter Mink and his prowling
ways.</p>

<p>To be sure, Master Meadow Mouse tried
to be careful. Before he crept from the
end of his tunnel, he stuck his head out
and looked up and down and all around.
He peeped under the bank of the brook.
He even stared into the water. And
then&mdash;if he saw nobody that was fiercer
than Paddy Muskrat&mdash;only then would he
venture to skip to the water's edge and
plunge in.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Master Meadow
Mouse always felt safer when one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Muskrat family happened to be taking a
swim at the same time. For the Muskrats
all had a warning signal that told
everybody when there was danger. When
one of them caught sight of Peter Mink
he never failed&mdash;if he was in the water&mdash;to
give a loud slap upon the surface with
his tail.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse always had one
ear that was listening for that slap. And
when it sounded he never waited an instant,
but darted into his tunnel without
even stopping to shake the water off his
coat. He said that he could dry his coat
after he reached home; while if he stopped
to dry it at the edge of the brook perhaps
he'd never get home at all.</p>

<p>You might think that now and then he
would have said to himself, "Oh, I won't
bother to look for Peter Mink to-day. He
must be miles away. I'll step right out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of my tunnel and have my swim without
taking a look-see first." But Master
Meadow Mouse was never so lazy as that.
And the day came at last when it was well
worth his while to take the little extra
trouble of peeping out before he had his
swim.</p>

<p>For Master Meadow Mouse caught a
glimpse of a snakelike head that darted
out from under the bank of the brook and
darted back again, out of sight. He
knew that that queer head belonged to
Peter Mink, and to nobody else.</p>

<p>"What are you doing up there?" Master
Meadow Mouse called.</p>

<p>"Fishing!" said Peter Mink promptly.</p>

<p>"Aren't you a long way from the
water?" Master Meadow Mouse inquired.</p>

<p>"With a pole, one doesn't need to stand
right at the water's edge," said Peter
Mink.</p>

<p>"But you haven't a pole," Master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Meadow Mouse pointed out. "At least,
I can't see that you have one."</p>

<p>Peter was greatly surprised&mdash;or seemed
to be.</p>

<p>"I declare!" he said. "I forgot to
bring my pole with me. And if you
hadn't reminded me of it I shouldn't have
known what was the trouble. I was wondering
why I didn't get any bites." As
he spoke he slid down the lower part of
the bank and stretched himself like a cat.
But all the time he was looking at Master
Meadow Mouse out of the corner of his
eye. "What are <i>you</i> doing here?"
Peter Mink asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I came to take a swim," Master
Meadow Mouse explained.</p>

<p>"Have you had it?"</p>

<p>"Not yet!" Master Meadow Mouse told
him. "And I believe I'll wait till to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"The water's fine to-day," said Peter
Mink. "I've been in and out of it forty
times."</p>

<p>But Master Meadow Mouse wasn't to
be persuaded so easily.</p>

<p>"I might spoil your fishing if I went
in now," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I don't care if you do," said Peter
Mink. "The pleasure of seeing you enjoy
a swim would more than repay me for the
loss of the biggest fish in this brook."</p>

<p>Now, such speeches sounded very
strange, coming from the mouth of a surly
rascal like Peter Mink, who was never
known to do anybody a good turn. Master
Meadow Mouse pondered over this last
statement. There seemed to be a catch in
it somewhere. And he decided, finally,
that he had discovered it.</p>

<p>"I didn't know there were any fish in
this brook worth catching," he piped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
"They say there were trout here once.
But now there's nothing bigger than a
minnow."</p>

<p>Peter Mink nodded. "That's the
truth," he said. "If this brook has a fish
that's as meaty as you are, I've never seen
him."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Master Meadow Mouse.
"You'd far rather catch me than catch a
fish in this pool."</p>

<p>Peter Mink grinned at him brazenly.</p>

<p>"I won't deny it," he replied.</p>

<p>"But you tried to deceive me," Master
Meadow Mouse told him. "You said&mdash;when
I asked you what you were doing
here&mdash;you said that you were fishing."</p>

<p>"So I was!" Peter Mink exclaimed with
a horrid chuckle. "I was fishing for
mice. And if you'd been a little less careful
I'd have caught one, too."</p>

<p>"Good day!" said Master Meadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Mouse. "Good day and good-by!"</p>

<p>"Don't say good-by!" Peter Mink corrected.
"Say, 'Till we meet again!'"</p>

<p>But Master Meadow Mouse had already
pulled his head out of sight and vanished
inside his tunnel.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Master Meadow Mouse</span> had a great-uncle
who was known as Uncle Billy. He was
the oldest of all the members of the
Meadow Mouse family that lived under
the snow near the brook. Hobbling along
through one of the tunnels beneath the
seven crusts of snow he happened to meet
Master Meadow Mouse as he was returning
from his talk with Peter Mink.</div>

<p>"I just saw Peter Mink at the brook!"
Master Meadow Mouse called.</p>

<p>"Ha!" Uncle Billy snorted. "The
question is, did he see you?"</p>

<p>"He did," Master Meadow Mouse an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>swered
with no little pride, for he felt
quite important. "He not only saw me.
He talked with me."</p>

<p>"Ha!" Uncle Billy snorted again.
"Then this is moving day."</p>

<p>"Why, it's not the first of May, is it?"
Master Meadow Mouse cried.</p>

<p>"Hardly!" said Uncle Billy, with
something like a sniff. "It's not Ground
Hog Day yet; and that's only the second
of February."</p>

<p>"Then why should anybody move, right
in the middle of winter?" Master Meadow
Mouse wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;" Uncle Billy declared
hotly&mdash;"because somebody has gone and
let Peter Mink know where we're spending
the winter. And it's not safe for us
to stay here any longer."</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse couldn't help
feeling guilty. Still, he hoped he hadn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
made as great a mistake as Uncle Billy
would have him believe.</p>

<p>"I've heard," he ventured, "that Peter
Mink can squeeze through any hole that's
big enough for his head. But surely he
couldn't get even his flat head into one of
our passages."</p>

<p>"He can burrow in the snow!" Uncle
Billy snapped. "He can and he will.
He'll come sniffing and listening all
around here. And when he finds a likely
spot to dig, down he'll go through drifts
and crusts until he reaches the stubble."
Uncle Billy shook his head and drew a
long breath. "Young man," he said,
"you've got us into a peck of trouble.
This whole village has to move. Don't
let it happen again!"</p>

<p>By that time others of the villagers had
gathered round and heard the news. Of
course the news spread fast. And in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
surprisingly short while the Meadow
Mouse family was on its way to the mill
pond.</p>

<p>Everybody set to work&mdash;everybody except
Uncle Billy Meadow Mouse. He was
busy telling all the rest what to do, though
he didn't help half as much as he thought
he did.</p>

<p>But every one was polite to him, for
he was the oldest Meadow Mouse on the
farm.</p>

<p>It wasn't long before they had everything
snug again. And as for Master
Meadow Mouse, he was actually glad that
he had made the whole village move.
For Paddy Muskrat lived in the mill
pond. He spent all his time there when
he wasn't taking excursions up the brook.
And Master Meadow Mouse found him
the best of company.</p>

<p>Especially did Master Meadow Mouse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
like to hear Paddy Muskrat slap his tail
upon the water, when he gave the danger
signal.</p>

</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Living</span>, as he did, near the mill pond,
Master Meadow Mouse saw a great deal
of Paddy Muskrat. They had a number
of tastes in common. They both liked
lily bulbs. They both enjoyed swimming.
They both disliked Peter Mink. They
were bound to become great cronies&mdash;if
for no other reason than the last.</div>

<p>By spring Paddy Muskrat knew Master
Meadow Mouse well enough to ask him
a very intimate question.</p>

<p>"Why does everybody call you 'Master'?"
he inquired one day.</p>

<p>Master Meadow Mouse looked at him in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a puzzled fashion for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered. "I
don't know why, unless it's because they
<i>always have</i> called me that. Don't you
think it's a good name?" he asked Paddy
Muskrat a bit anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" Paddy assured him.
"There's no doubt that it's a good enough
name. But it's one that's given to a
youngster&mdash;to a mere child."</p>

<p>"I'm not a youngster!" Master Meadow
Mouse cried. "Nobody can call me
<i>young</i>. I'm almost a year old!"</p>

<p>"I thought so," said Paddy Muskrat,
as if he knew he couldn't have been mistaken.
"You're grown up. And yet
they still call you 'Master' Meadow
Mouse. If I were you I'd get folks to
change that."</p>

<p>It was plain that Master Meadow Mouse
agreed with him in every way. He had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
already made up his mind that he wouldn't
answer to the name of 'Master' Meadow
Mouse any longer. And he told Paddy
Muskrat as much.</p>

<p>"If they want me to answer after this,
they'll have to call me something else," he
declared. "Now, what would you suggest?"</p>

<p>Paddy Muskrat said he needed time to
think the matter over. And he thought
that he'd like to consult his wife, who
always had an opinion.</p>

<p>"Wait here till I come back!" he told
Master Meadow Mouse. And, diving
into the water, he swam home. He was
back in a few minutes, with a broad smile
upon his face. "I've thought of the very
thing!" he exclaimed. "Or, at least, my
wife has. She says, 'Call him "Mister,"
of course'!"</p>

<p>"That's fine!" cried Master Meadow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Mouse. "I'm sure I couldn't have
thought of that if I'd tried all summer.
And now," he added, "I must go and tell
everybody about this sudden change."</p>

<p>So he hurried home. And, calling
everybody around him, he explained that
he was a year old, and that he had successfully
dodged Miss Kitty Cat, Tommy
Fox, Solomon Owl, Ferdinand Frog,
Peter Mink, Old Mr. Crow and goodness
only knew how many other dangerous
folk.</p>

<p>"I'm grown up now," he told his hearers.
"From this time on I expect everybody
to call me <i>Mister</i> Meadow Mouse."</p>

<p>And everybody said that a new name
was no more than he deserved. They all
approved his choice.</p>

<p>No! There was just one among all the
company that was opposed to the change.
He snorted and started to say something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
disagreeable. And for once everybody
told Uncle Billy (for it was he!) to be
quiet.</p>

<p>And that was the end of Master Meadow
Mouse.</p>
